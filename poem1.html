                        <p>We are on our knees</p>
                        <p>We are saying that the tulips have had it hard this week. We are saying something about the brightness & the dryness & we are saying we hope it will change.</p>
                        <p>I press a finger into the loam, flick the dust on my jeans. We are listening to the snip of shears. I pick up a smooth, small disc of pink Sioux quartz, hold it like an avian heart in the palm. A disc slipped and beating from a time when all of North America was under sea.</p>
                        <p>My finger walks the buttery vein that parses the stone in two and then in four.Its edges are under siege; its end at the foot of suburban perennials.</p>
                        <p>Do you have stones, someone is asking me.Where you are from, do you have stones, like these.</p>
                        <p>We have purple sunbirds, I am saying, and their hearts have four rooms, one for every answer to questions like these.</p>
